# Encoding Mashup

This is a system to help users find the correct Unicode or the CNS 11643 encoding
for Han characters found as pictures (due to the limitation of Big-5)
in many dictionaries published by the Ministry of Education (Taiwan).
This project is part of the g0v project.

Here are the tentative list of registered characters.
We loosely follow the syntax of URI paths.

- `moe/revised/xxxx`
- `moe/twblg/xxxx`
- `moe/hakka/xxxx`

## Development Environment

We are trying to follow these coding styles and conventions:

* [Git commit message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) (by tpope).

The backend is written in Haskell with the Snap web framework.
To set up the development environment, you first have to install GHC. For example, on Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install ghc haskell-platform postgresql-9.1 postgresql-contrib-9.1

Using GHC of version at least 7.4 is recommended. Also, using cabal-dev to build up a virtual environment is a good practice. To install it using cabal-install

    cabal update
    cabal install cabal-dev

Then do the following:

    git clone <this repository>
    cabal-dev install --only-dependencies
    cabal-dev build

## Testing

We have not set up a nice interface for importing the data.
Currently, to test the server with existing data, do the following:

    wget 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AttD1zENsweydFhtZXhKVjdId1JTRkFrSmhvZXozNGc&single=true&gid=0&output=txt' -O sym-google.txt
    python2 ./resources/csv2sqlite.py google.csv [path to the database]
    [run the server]


## Database Auditing

We are using postgresql's [91plus](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Audit_trigger_91plus) trigger to audit table.
Please make sure you have installed the [hstore](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/hstore.html) extension (contained in postgresql-contrib-9.1).
After you install it, execute the following steps.

    sudo -u postgres psql < /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/extension/hstore--unpackaged--1.0.sql
    sudo -u postgres psql < <this_repo_dir>/resources/audit.sql

Any INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE will be audited, to look up the log, execute:

    SELECT * FROM audit.logged_actions LIMIT 5;

## Deployment

We use [keter](https://github.com/snoyberg/keter) deploy the project. To install it, execute:

    wget -O - https://raw.github.com/snoyberg/keter/master/setup-keter.sh | bash

To deploy, tarball ``config``, ``dist/build/encoding-mashup-server/encoding-mashup-server`` and ``static`` as ``.keter``

    tar zcvf encoding-mashup.keter config static dist/build/encoding-mashup-server/encoding-mashup-server

Then copy ``encoding-mashup.keter`` to ``/opt/keter/incoming/`` on the server. It will automatically deploy it..
